## Background
- Impact Investing, aka Sustainable/Responsible/ESG Investing, seeks to deliver competitive financial returns while driving positive environmental, social and governance (ESG) outcomes. Over the past few years, impact investing has gained significant momentum among asset managers; it now accounts for more than one-fourth of total assets under management (AUM) in the U.S., with AUM growing to 12 trillion, up 38% from the start of 2016 to the start of 2018. Total assets in sustainable investing exceeded 30 trillion globally at the start of 2018, with institutions accounting for 75% of the total.

- Yet there are few outlets that exist to address retail investors' needs. As specified before, only 25% of AUM was from retail. As demographics shift, we believe the new generation of retail investors, who are already showing strong preferences and willing to pay a premium for the green and sustainable product (i.e. vegetarian burgers, electronic vehicles), have unfilled needs to help them identify and measure ESG investments. Just as Robinhood has democratized investing, we're creating a product to democratize impact investing for all.

## Conclusion
- There are a growing number of ESG ETFs but the measures of ESG scores/exposure of portfolio holdings are relatively limited. We confirm from our hypothesis that there is significant unmet need to help retail investors gain exposure to impact investing. 

- On the whole, ETFs in many ESG themes severely underperform the S&P. Future of portfolio analytics should include ESG scores to help investors track investment goals as well as how they are impacting the world.

- Large performance discrepancy amongst different ETFs so there is value to help investors choose better-performing funds while making the world better. We need to continue to enhance ESG investment framework and expand range of ESG investment options to retail investors.
